# lane-emden-eq

This is the script in Fortran, I used in the course 'Astronomical Computing' exam (translated from "Calcolo per l'Astronomia") I took in July 2020.

It basically 

  1. integrates the Lane-Emden Equation numerically by using a 4th Order Runge-Kutta algorithm;
  2. finds the \xi_0 (radius of the star) by a bisection algorithm and
  3. computes the critical mass of Chandrasekhar.
